    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Anthony Round, an aspiring developer based in Folkestone, UK. I’ve been programming for 3 years, primarily in Unity, focusing on game development with C#. Recently, I’ve shifted my focus to web development and completed the Codecademy Full Stack course.</p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy making games, playing action RPGs, being a Game Master for Dungeons & Dragons, hiking, and traveling. I’m passionate about blending creativity and technology, whether in game development or web applications.</p>
    <p>My goal is to continue growing as a developer and contribute to innovative projects that make an impact. I’m eager to connect with other developers and potential employers who share my passion for creative problem-solving.</p>
